# Kidz Blocks
Our project will be a web based application hosting an assortment of educational (or classic) games, which tracks the users performance. The games will likely be geared toward education, with a target audience of adults with small children, whom they are able to play the games along side with.

# General Information
## 1: Who you’re working with (you and your team members)?
Jake Elrod, Robert Bonham, Robert Elizondo, Jacob Lopez, Oscar Fortanel Benitiez
## 2: What you’re creating?
Our group is creating an educational website which features games that are geared towards educating young children ideally grades 1st-5th. The user should be able to choose an age group and will be given a selection of games to play based on their age group. We would also like to implement a leaderboard for each game or some type of data we can return to the player. We will implement a responsive web design to cater to younger ages preferring handheld devices. 
The trend of technology is heading towards web-based applications and having experience building that type of application will allow the developers in this group to talk confidently about our experiences working with the technologies surrounding web-based design to future employers. 
## 3: Who you’re doing it for, your audience (may be same as the previous question)?
Our primary audience would be adults with small children, who want an interactive way to have fun teaching their children basic ideas. The experience should be fun for both the parent and the child. The parent that is looking to educate their children will be primary audience sought-after. The age range of parents will be from 20 – 40 years old and the age range of children will be from 3-10 years of age. 
## 4: Why you’re doing this, the impact or change you hope to make?
From this project we hope to gain the ability to make a frictionless webpage which could potentially be transformed into a model application. Learning how to create an interactive website that is easy enough to be used by children will be a new feat. We hope to gain insight on how to piece together a coherent series of interactive web pages that could later be adapted into a mobile application. We hope that this web application will impact underprivileged youth and enable them to perform at a higher level during the beginning of their scholastic career.

## Missing
We are missing web game development experience. None of the developers have ever built a web based interactive game. Also lack in design, this will be important because the design must be simplistic for our audience base.

        * I restructure the files for future development to make putting new implementation in the correct files.
    * Jira: KID-33 - Determine what elements should be included on each webpages, and where they should be included (things like logo, navigation menu, and buttons)
        * For the first sprint I just went with whatever what necessary at the time of implemenation and expect for the elements to be switched out for a more unified agreement between the team.
    * Jira: KID-30 - Create a simple navigation interface for users to transition between games easily

    * Jira: KID-18 - Three Game Web Pages
        * After restructing the file system i was able to create the three webpages for each of the grade groups we decided as a team. 
    * Next Steps: I will likely begin researching and implementing the games the team have found during the first sprint to be added to their respected game pages. 

* Jacob Lopez
    * Design board creation.
        * This board includes fonts, colors to be used, and various design elements that can be used as buttons, game icons or other front-end elements.

    * Research
        * Though the sprint started with the idea that this research would help us choose which ages we should split our buttons up into there is not much research on the target ages we are going for. 
        * Most information on content review for games is geared towards an older gamer with more levels of viloence and gore and sexuality where we are created more of a developmental/educational type website. 
        * The commit date for this is so late in the sprint because information will continue to be added as I run accross more information. 
      *https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-betazoids/kidzblocks/commits/0199db6c6706643461b69d00594ccb489dceca89

# Sprint 3 - Contributions and Next Steps
* Jake Elrod
    * All of my tasks are associated to feature branches however, on Jira Sotware some of the task do not properly represent this even though
    * Bitbucket shows that all tasks have branches which have a pull request and have been merged into master. Dr. Lehr is aware of this issue.
    * Jira Task: KID- 84 - Implement "Letters" game into the website
        * After the "letters" game was refactored, I would have the game posted on the back end or drive and then make a reference to it from that 
        * game's html file. Durrign this implementation, some bugs may have been found and then fixed. This contribution allows the "letters" game 
        * to be assessable from our website.

    * Jira Task: KID- 86 - Refactor "Letters" game for leader board
        * Durring this task, I created a maximum score of 25 in the game "letters." I also implemented a timer that starts at the beginning of the game. This way
        * when the user reached the high score of 25 it would ask the user for their name. At this time, the name and score data is sent to the back end. 
        * The prorgam then would out put their name and their high score, prompting the user to check the leader board to see if their score made it. This contribution
        * enabled a high score and conected the game to the back end which constructs our leader board.

        * Durring this task, I created a maximum score of 2048 in the game "2048." I also implemented a timer that starts at the beginning of the game. This way
        * when the user reached the high score of 2048 it would ask the user for their name. At this time, the name and score data is sent to the back end.

    * Jira Task: KID- 99 - Refactor "Numbers" game for leader board
        * Durring this task, I used a timer that was already implemeneted into the game which starts at the beginning of the game and counts down from 30 to 
        * the end of the game at 0. This way when the user reached the time of 0 it would ask the user for their name. At this time, the name and score  
        * data is sent to the back end. The prorgam then would out put their name and their high score, prompting the user to check the leader board to see if their 
        * score made it. This contribution enabled a high score and conected the game to the back end which constructs our leader board.

    * Jira Task: KID- 104 - Find new Letters & Numbers games and update relative documents
        * I found two new games for "letters" & "numbers" as well as updated the relevant documents. The README.md file was updated
        * to acknowledge the creators of the games. The document "9 Games - KID 21 - Elrod.pdf" was also updated to show these changes. This contribution
        * gave us two game to refactor and implement into our project because the previous two games chosen where decidably not going to work.
        * https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-betazoids/kidzblocks/commits/8fc765f5d8a2b057e1e31d2e57298539952f2f32
    * Next Steps: If this project was to continue into the next sprint, my next steps would be to fix the "letters" game, at the moment it  
        * takes this game about 15 seconds to load and this loading time could be sped up. I would also take it upon myself to fix the css 
        * of the user interface that way it is more desirable by the user, an example would be fixing the size of the button images and the 
        * size and placement of the buttons. Although the game code for "numbers" and "tic tac toe" is correct, the back end emplementation 
        * is incorrect. Durring the next sprint, I could help the teamate who emplemented the back end to fix the "numbers" and 
        * "tic tac toe" games that way they are running correctly. We could also implemet advertisement to start creating revenue.
